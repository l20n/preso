Responsive localization with L20n
=================================

Adapting your web application not only to languages and cultures, but also 
contextual data, user gender and screen dimensions.

L20n is a research project from Mozilla that after years of work is currently 
reaching it's first stable release. Its fundamentally different approach to 
user interface localization opens up new possibilities for building 
multicultural applications keeping easy things easy, and complex things 
possible.
